# Farnaz Mozaffari . Jarvis Consulting
I recently completed my master's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Guelph with a focus on AI applications. 
During my master's studies, I worked with different datasets and developed machine learning and deep learning models mainly in python for various applications such as cybersecurity systems. 
With my strong background in analyzing and interpreting large dataset and development of highly accurate forecasting systems, I started my training program at Jarvis Consulting group. 
Developing various projects at Jarvis led me to become skilled in debugging and increasing code efficiency in PostgreSQL and Java Stream APIs as well as gaining comprehensive knowledge of REST APIs, and Spring framework. 
I am a self-initiated and motivated person with a passion in implementing complex algorithms. Also, I am eager to have positive impact on business transformation and performance improvement. 
With my rewarding experience at Jarvis, I am confident I will be a great candidate for Software Development opportunities mainly in the fields of Data and Machine-learning Engineering.

## Development Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_farnaz](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_farnaz)

- **[Cluster Monitor](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_farnaz/tree/master/linux_sql)**:  Built a real-time internal tool that collects and records the hardware specifications and node resource usages, such as CPU and memory information. 
                                       Stores the collected data in a locally hosted PostgreSQL database, which is provisioned by docker container. Implemented by using Bash Scripts and PostgreSQL.
- **[Core Java Apps](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_farnaz/tree/master/core_java)**: Consists of three different projects with using Appache Maven for project management and building each application:
    
    - **Grep App:** Designed Java 8's Stream APIs based application that utilizes pattern matching methods. Searches recursively through all the files in a directory for the lines that matches the provided regular expression. Outputs the matched lines into a new file.
              
    - **JDBC:** Developed JDBC based application that acts as a bridge between the RDBMS and the Java application. Allows users to connect to PostgreSQL and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    
    - **Twitter App:** Implemented Twitter CLI application that interacts via Twitter REST API by forming arguments into HTTP requests. 
    Enables users to create a tweet with a geotag and output the created tweet object in JSON format. 
    Through this minus V based application, looking up or deleting a tweet by ID can be achieved.
                       
   
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**: In progress
- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: Not started
- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: Not started
- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  Not started
